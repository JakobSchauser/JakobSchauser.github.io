                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently a PhD fellow in TrusinaLab in the Biocomplexity Group at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. My research focuses on how elementary physical principles can lead to interesting biological phenomena.</p>
                <p>My work involves using modeling to understand the many emergent properties of the incredible natural world. Nature consists of simple rules and complex behaviors - and, importantly, these are not opposites!</p>
                <p>Recently, I have been exploring Neural Cellular Automata as a tool for understanding large-scale reverberation of local dynamics.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I love movies, music, games, and books. Any recommendations are appreciated!</p>
