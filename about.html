                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently a PhD fellow in TrusinaLab in the Biocomplexity Group at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. My research focuses on how simple physical principles can lead to complex biological phenomena.</p>
                <p>My work involves using modeling to understand the many emergent properties of the incredible natural world.</p>
                <p>Recently, I have been exploring Neural Cellular Automata as a tool for understanding the interplay between local and global dynamics.</p>
                <p>I love movies, music, games, and books. Any recommendations are appreciated!</p>
